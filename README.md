A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

An authentication system is a vital component of any web application that involves user registration, login, and authentication. It helps ensure that only authorized users can access certain features and data within the application.

Using a starter code for creating a complete authentication system in Node.js can save time and effort for developers. It provides a baseline structure that can be customized according to the specific needs of the web application and optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices. With a complete authentication system in place, developers can focus on building the core features of the application while ensuring that user data is secure and protected..

Node.js is a popular backend technology used for building web applications. It provides developers with a range of tools and frameworks to build scalable, efficient, and secure web applications. Creating a complete authentication system in Node.js can be a challenging task, especially for new developers. However, having a reliable authentication system is essential to the security of a web application.
